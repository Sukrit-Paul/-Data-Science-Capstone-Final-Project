## Word Prediction App Description

Want to know the predicted next word? 
Use our new app...

- Users start to type a sentence, the app predicts next word
- App uses a subset of data from the three data sources (blogs, twitter & news)
- App also uses the technology of Swiftkey

Try it now...select it [here](https://sukritpaulshiny123.shinyapps.io/Datascience_capstone1/)

## How to Use the Word Prediction App

## Data Gathering & Cleansing 

- Merged data from the 3 Data Sources into one data file (Blogs, Twitter & News)
- Cleansed data including converting to lowercase, stripping white space, and removing punctuation & numbers
- Created Bigram, Trigram and Quadgram n-grams
- Extracted term-count tables from the n-grams
- Sorted in descending order based on frequency
- Saved n-gram objects

## Word Prediction Algorithm & Summary

- Algoithm checks for the highest-order n-gram (n=4)  
- If n=4 is not found, then checks the next lower-order model (n=3)
- If n=3 is not found, then the app continues to check (n=2)
- If n=2 is not found, then the app returns "No Match Found"

- Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sukrit-Paul/-Data-Science-Capstone-Final-Project/tree/master)
- Further work can include expanding both the number of data sources & number of n-grams
Enjoy the app!
